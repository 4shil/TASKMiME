# Musicya

## How to Run the App

**IMPORTANT**: This project is structured with the Flutter application inside the `musicya_flutter` directory. The root directory contains documentation and analysis reports.

To run the application, you must execute commands from the `musicya_flutter` directory.

### Command Line
1.  Open your terminal.
2.  Navigate to the flutter folder:
    ```powershell
    cd musicya_flutter
    ```
3.  Run the app:
    ```powershell
    flutter run
    ```

### Android Studio / VS Code
-   Ensure your "Flutter Target" or "Entry point" is set to `musicya_flutter/lib/main.dart`.
-   Do **not** try to run the root `app` folder as an Android project.

## Troubleshooting
-   If you see `Error: No pubspec.yaml file found`, you are in the wrong directory. `cd musicya_flutter` and try again.
